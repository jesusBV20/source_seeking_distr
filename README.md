# Resiliend Source Seeking - Distributed computation

In this repository, we implement a distributed computation algorithm to estimate the ascending direction given by our resilient source-seeking algorithm for robot swarms. To understand the mathematical theory behind this code, we highly recommend to consult our following works:
