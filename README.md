# Resiliend Source Seeking - Distributed computation

In this repository, we implement a distributed computation algorithm to estimate the ascending direction given by our resilient source-seeking algorithm for robot swarms.  For a comprehensive understanding of the mathematical theory underlying this code, we highly recommend to consult our following works:
