    WIP
    
## Installation

To install the required dependencies, simply run:

```bash
python install.py
```

### Additional Dependencies
Some additional dependencies, such as LaTeX fonts and FFmpeg, may be required. We recommend following the installation instructions provided in the ```ssl_simulator``` [README](https://github.com/Swarm-Systems-Lab/ssl_simulator/blob/master/README.md). 

To verify that all additional dependencies are correctly installed on Linux, run:
```bash
bash test/test_dep.sh
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebooks inside the `notebooks` directory and/or the Python application inside `apps`.
